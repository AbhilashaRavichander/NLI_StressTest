## What is Natural Language Inference?

Natural language inference (NLI) is the task of determining if a natural language hypothesis can be inferred from a given
premise in a justifiable manner. This requires a model to make the 3-way decision of whether a hypothesis is true given the premise (entailment), false given the premise (contradiction), or whether the truth value cannot be determined (neutral). The MultiNLI corpus is a large-scale dataset for Natural Language Inference featuring premise-hypothesis pairs from ten different genres of text. Youc an learn more about it [here](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/), and about the RepEval shared task [here](https://repeval2017.github.io/shared/) which evaluated models that formed sentence-representations on the Natural language Inference task.
